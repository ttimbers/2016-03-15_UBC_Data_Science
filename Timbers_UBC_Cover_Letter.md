Dear Data Science Teaching Fellow Search Committee,

I am writing to apply for the position of a Postdoctoral Teaching & Learning Fellow, 
associated with a proposed Master of Data Science (MDS) program at the University of 
British Columbia (UBC). This opportunity was brought to my attention by Dr. Jenny Bryan, 
Associate Professor of Statistics and Academic Director of this proposed MDS program at 
UCB. Currently, I am a Banting Postdoctoral Fellow at Simon Fraser University (SFU). My 
research involves complex visualization and statistical analyses of large genomic and 
multi-dimensional phenotype datasets with the aim of uncovering new genes important for 
sensation. Outside of the research lab I am actively involved in teaching and developing 
data science curriculum through my affiliations with SFU, Quest University, Software 
Carpentry and the Mozilla Science lab.

The position of a Postdoctoral Teaching & Learning Fellow with the proposed MDS program 
really excites me because Data Science is a critically important, emerging 
interdisciplinary field, yet few structured educational programs support training for it.
I want to be involved in the breaking ground of this program to help develop a holistic 
data science graduate curriculum at UBC. That this program is a collaboration between the 
Departments of Computer Science and Statistics indicates that there will be excellent 
support for the development and implementation of this program. I am impressed with the 
pedagogical approaches outlined for the proposed program, in particular the planned use of 
intensive courses and a final capstone project. I have experience teaching computational 
materials at Quest University in an intensive format and I find it allows an unprecedented
depth of study into the subject matter. I am also excited about this 
position because of the possibility to contribute to other Data Science research projects
undertaken by the Statistical Consulting and Research Laboratory.

Of the courses outlined to be offered for the MDS program, I would love to focus on 
developing curriculum and teaching in the areas of programming and data science workflows,
data wrangling, data visualization, collaborative software development as well as web and 
cloud computing. My hands-on experience with R, Python, SQL and version control in my own
research, as well as my experience teaching and developing curriculum on these topics 
provide me with the necessary skills and tools to hit the ground running and quickly 
develop curriculum on this topics.  I have over 11 years of teaching experience spanning 
many topics (computation in science, bioinformatics, biology, psychology) across many 
formats. I have taught two upper level undergraduate courses, two-day intensive workshops,
shorter 1-3 hour workshops, and week-long field/summer courses. 

Although I am not classically trained as a statistician, I have done a tremendous amount
of self-guided learning in this field and act as the in-lab statistics consultant for the 
lab where I do my postdoctoral research. I have elected to take several statistics courses, including  High-Dimensional Omics Data 
and Pathway & Network Analysis for Omics at the Summer Institute for Statistical Genetics
at the University of Washington, as well as Trevor Hastie and Rob Tibshirani's online 
course titled "Introduction to Statistical Learning". I also attend and present at the 
[Statistical Genetics Working Group](http://stat.sfu.ca/statgen.html) in the Department of 
Statistics and Actuarial Science at SFU. Finally, my self guided learning has included reading much referring to and reading of
["The Handbook of Biological Statistics"](http://www.biostathandbook.com/) and ["An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/).
Thus, while I am not a statistician in training, I utilize many different statistical tools
and analyses for my work and discuss these tools and analyses with statisticians and 
biologists on a regular basis. 

Thank-you for considering me for the position of a Postdoctoral Teaching & Learning Fellow, 
associated with a proposed Master of Data Science program at the University of 
British Columbia. In addition to this letter, please find my [curriculum vitae](https://github.com/ttimbers/2016-03-15_UBC_Data_Science/blob/master/Timbers_UBC_CV.md), [list of 
references](https://github.com/ttimbers/2016-03-15_UBC_Data_Science/blob/master/Timbers_UBC_references.md) and [teaching portfolio](https://github.com/ttimbers/2016-03-15_UBC_Data_Science/blob/master/Timbers_UBC_Teaching_Portfolio.md) attached to this application. In support of my application, I would
also like to present my most recent research project, which is available as a preprint [here](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/10/22/027540), and all associated code is 
available in [this Github repository](https://github.com/ttimbers/Million-Mutation-Project-dye-filling-SKAT).

Sincerely,

Tiffany A. Timbers, Ph.D.
